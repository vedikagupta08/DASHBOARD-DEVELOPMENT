# Description
This project develops an interactive Power BI dashboard to predict and visualize heart disease risk based on clinical parameters from a modified Superstore Sales dataset, adapted for health analytics. The dashboard provides actionable insights for healthcare decision-making.

# Dataset
The dashboard utilizes a modified Superstore Sales dataset, comprising 918 rows and 18 columns, including Row ID, Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, and Sales, reinterpreted as health metrics (e.g., Sales as a proxy for patient visits or costs).

# Models Used
No explicit machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) are implemented due to dataset constraints; instead, it relies on data visualization for predictive insights.
Visual trends (e.g., Sales by Category) serve as proxies for identifying high-risk patient groups.

# Steps Performed
Data Loading and Cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) via visuals
Feature Selection (e.g., Category, Region, Product Name as health indicators)
Dashboard Layout Design
Visual Creation (Pie Chart, Cards, Table)
Interactivity Implementation
Insight Generation

# How to Run
Clone or download the folder
